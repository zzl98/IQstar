Component: <task 4 (and its helper methods) & the Objective class>

### Comments 

<Sineeha has effectively completed task 4. It is well documented explaining what each part of the code does and why it is there. One thing that Sineeha could do would be to implement more methods or classes to simplify the code, although already this is a fine answer to the task. Naming of variables is good as well, overall the code works and it completes the task well.>;
