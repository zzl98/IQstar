Component: Task 3

### Comments

 Best part of the code :
   
    a. The code is easy to understand and is well written.
    
    b. Use of if- else statement makes it easier to read.

 is code well documented & Style and name of variables :

    The style part is excellent the code is well-structured .
    
    Comments are added everywhere for better understanding.
    
    The choice of variables could have been better. 
   
    But the code is really easy to understand because of its structure.

 Is the program decomposition appropriate :
  
    The requirement of the task can be fulfilled in a single method as done by Zhilin 

    and I think the way he did it is the perfect way to tackle the problem.
